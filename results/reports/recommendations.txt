UWB LOS/NLOS Classification - Recommendations
==================================================

Model Selection
--------------------

1. For optimal accuracy, ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting generally perform best on this dataset due to their ability to capture complex relationships between features.

2. If computational resources are limited (e.g., in embedded systems), simpler models like Decision Trees or Logistic Regression can provide a good balance between performance and efficiency.

3. For deployment in real-time systems, consider using models that offer faster inference times, such as optimized implementations of Decision Trees.

Feature Engineering
--------------------

1. Focus on the top-ranked features identified in our analysis, particularly those related to signal amplitude and power characteristics.

2. Consider engineered features that combine multiple raw measurements, such as ratios between different amplitude components.

3. For improved performance, explore frequency-domain features derived from the Channel Impulse Response (CIR).

Deployment Strategies
--------------------

1. Implement a two-stage positioning approach where LOS/NLOS classification is performed first, followed by position calculation using only LOS measurements.

2. In environments with frequent NLOS conditions, consider deploying additional anchors to ensure that enough LOS measurements are available.

3. Periodically retrain the model using data collected from the specific deployment environment to account for environmental changes.

Performance Monitoring
--------------------

1. Implement a confidence score based on the model's probability output to flag uncertain classifications.

2. Regularly validate the model's performance using ground truth data collected in the deployment environment.

3. Consider ensemble approaches that combine multiple models for more robust classification, especially in challenging environments.
