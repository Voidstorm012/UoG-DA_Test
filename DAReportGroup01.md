## 1. Problem Definition

### 1.1 Background

Indoor positioning systems require accurate distance measurements between anchors and tags. In Ultra-Wideband (UWB) systems, Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions significantly degrade ranging accuracy, leading to positioning errors. This project focuses on solving two critical challenges:

1. **Classification Challenge**: Accurately identifying whether a UWB measurement is from a Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) condition.
2. **Range Estimation Challenge**: Predicting the true distance between devices, especially in NLOS conditions where measured ranges are typically biased.

### 1.2 Importance and Applications

Accurate LOS/NLOS classification and range estimation are essential for:

- **Indoor Positioning Systems**: Enabling centimeter-level accuracy in indoor environments
- **Robotics and Autonomous Navigation**: Providing reliable positioning in complex indoor settings
- **Asset Tracking**: Improving inventory management and logistics operations
- **Smart Buildings**: Enhancing occupancy detection and room-level positioning
- **AR/VR Applications**: Supporting precise spatial mapping and user positioning

### 1.3 Project Objectives

This project aims to:

1. Develop an accurate classifier to distinguish between LOS and NLOS UWB measurements
2. Identify the most significant features that affect LOS/NLOS conditions
3. Create a range estimation model to correct for biases in NLOS measurements
4. Evaluate model performance using rigorous metrics and cross-validation

## 2. Problem Analysis

### 2.1 Dataset Overview

The UWB LOS/NLOS dataset contains:
- 42,000 samples (21,000 LOS, 21,000 NLOS)
- Data collected from 7 different indoor environments
- 15 metadata features + 1016 Channel Impulse Response (CIR) values per sample

### 2.2 Initial Data Exploration

Our exploratory analysis revealed:
- A balanced dataset (50% LOS, 50% NLOS)
- Significant differences in signal characteristics between LOS and NLOS conditions
- Strong correlations between certain features and LOS/NLOS classification
- Variations in CIR patterns indicative of multipath effects in NLOS scenarios

### 2.3 Key Challenges

The main challenges identified include:
- High dimensionality due to the 1016 CIR values
- Potential redundancy in features
- Variations across different indoor environments
- Need for robust models that generalize to new environments

### 2.4 Novelty of Our Approach

Our solution is novel in several ways:
- We apply feature engineering to extract key characteristics from the CIR
- We implement a two-stage pipeline: classification followed by range estimation
- We utilize ensemble learning to improve robustness and accuracy
- We incorporate domain knowledge about UWB signal propagation into our models
